                <p>Elon Musk</b>, (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa), South African-born American
                entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal and formed SpaceX, maker of launch
                vehicles and spacecraft. He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as chief
                executive officer of, the electric car manufacturer Tesla.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Early Life</h2>
                <p>Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for
                    computers and entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer
                    magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because he was
                    unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory military service and because he sought the greater
                    economic opportunities available in the United States.</p>

                <p>
                    Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the University
                    of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in
                    1997. He enrolled in graduate school in physics at Stanford University in California, but he left
                    after only two days because he felt that the Internet had much more potential to change society than
                    work in physics. In 1995 he founded Zip2, a company that provided maps and business directories to
                    online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million, and
                    Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which
                    specialized in transferring money online. The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5
                    billion.
                    Musk was long convinced that for life to survive, humanity has to become a multiplanet species.
                    However, he was dissatisfied with the great expense of rocket launchers. In 2002 he founded Space
                    Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets were the
                    Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which were
                    designed to cost much less than competing rockets. A third rocket, the Falcon Heavy (first launched
                    in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly twice as much as its
                    largest competitor, the Boeing Company’s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the cost. SpaceX has
                    announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy: the Super Heavy–Starship system. The
                    Super Heavy first stage would be capable of lifting 100,000 kg (220,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit.
                    The payload would be the Starship, a spacecraft designed for providing fast transportation between
                    cities on Earth and building bases on the Moon and Mars. SpaceX also developed the Dragon
                    spacecraft, which carries supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). Dragon can carry as
                    many as seven astronauts, and it had a crewed flight carrying astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert
                    Behnken to the ISS in 2020. Musk sought to reduce the expense of spaceflight by developing a fully
                    reusable rocket that could lift off and return to the pad it launched from. Beginning in 2012,
                    SpaceX’s Grasshopper rocket made several short flights to test such technology. In addition to being
                    CEO of SpaceX, Musk was also chief designer in building the Falcon rockets, Dragon, and Grasshopper.

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Tesla</h2>
                <p>
                    Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one of
                    the major funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla), an electric car company founded by
                    entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the
                    Roadster, which could travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric
                    vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car that could go from 0
                    to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company’s initial public
                    offering raised about $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was
                    acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design. The company won further praise for
                    its Model X luxury SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, a less-expensive vehicle,
                    went into production in 2017.'
                    Musk expressed reservations about Tesla being publicly traded, and in August 2018 he made a series
                    of tweets about taking the company private, noting that he had “secured funding.” The following
                    month the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for securities fraud, alleging
                    that the tweets were “false and misleading.” Shortly thereafter Tesla’s board rejected the SEC’s
                    proposed settlement, reportedly because Musk had threatened to resign. However, the news sent Tesla
                    stock plummeting, and a harsher deal was ultimately accepted. Its terms included Musk stepping down
                    as chairman for three years, though he was allowed to continue as CEO.

                    Dissatisfied with the projected cost ($68 billion) of a high-speed rail system in California, Musk
                    in 2013 proposed an alternate faster system, the Hyperloop, a pneumatic tube in which a pod carrying
                    28 passengers would travel the 350 miles (560 km) between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 35
                    minutes at a top speed of 760 miles (1,220 km) per hour, nearly the speed of sound. Musk claimed
                    that the Hyperloop would cost only $6 billion and that, with the pods departing every two minutes on
                    average, the system could accommodate the six million people who travel that route every year.
                    However, he stated that, between running SpaceX and Tesla, he could not devote time to the
                    Hyperloop’s development.
